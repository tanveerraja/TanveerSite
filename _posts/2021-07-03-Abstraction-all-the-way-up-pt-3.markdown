### Encapsulation

Per [Collins Dictionary](hhttps://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/encapsulate):

"To encapsulate particular facts or ideas means to represent all their most important aspects in a very small space or in a single object or event."

I think of it as encasing various observations in a way that they are linked and associated together such that they can be considered part of a cohesive whole. Once the structure has been established then the whole can be encapsulated within a naming convention.

There is a counter play to abstraction itself within the paradigm where you may abstract away specific or general details yet the original structure is still conceptually available to further development by adding or removing details.

An example of this interplay could be the concept of racism where a set of physical or cultural details are encapsulated in the form of the "other" - a person not being a direct member of the in-group but recognised as a human. Yet the racist can abstract the commonalities between themselves and the other and instead only focus on those elements which categorise the other as undesirable or dangerous.

The mental framework of racism can be dissolved if more positive qualities of the "other" are reinforced. Whether they be commonalities or the benefits of difference the buttressing of these points can create an encapsulation which is then easier to swallow since the abstraction of differences is positive.
