### Accounting and me

It could have been:

"As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be *an accountant*"

But no, my feelings for my profession weren't quite the same as Henry Hill from [Goodfellas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vUUdRsDgVA) had, but I have been told by my parents that as a fresh-faced four year old immigrant to the UK I was impressed by the grandeur of the North London flat we initially stayed at and after being told that the owner was an accountant, I proclaimed that I too would like to be an accountant.

Maybe the story was apocryphal, but it was repeated enough that it determined a career path.

Fun fact - I'm old enough to have done a weeks work experience as a teenager in the mid-90's at an Accountancy firm who were still recording transactions in real physical ledgers (big books with a special format for inputting transactions) and I got to use an adding machine (think calculator with an integrated physical print roll).

Wikipedia has a great entry on the [History of Accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_accounting), which was of interest to me because for a long time I was under the impression that double entry accounting was created by an Italian monk and popularised in use by the mercantile class during the Renaissance. However it appears that the general concept of recording transactions to *account* for changes in stocks of physical goods dates back several thousand years and is very likely inextricably linked to the development of the technologies of writing, counting and money themselves. I mean who doesn't want to make sure that the priests accurately record a supplicant's offerings to the Gods so there isn't any mistake in the allocation of blessings by an all seeing and powerful deity later on.

Over the centuries the profession of accounting has widened, yet modern accounting still uses the fundamental principles of duality and balancing an equation in it's core concepts of Debit and Credit. This equivalence of one side matching the other harks back to Al-Khwarizmi's book of Al-Jabr, and provides us with a means to check the correctness of our entries.

In my mind similar to Newtons Third Law of Motion - for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, thus for accounting there is always and equal and opposite entry for every transaction that needs to be recorded in a set of accounting books.

Accounting as a practice has continued to evolve through technological changes in the tools and conventions applied to the constant demand of reliable financial information but the basics of balancing give and take in human interactions has stayed constant and so I envisage the demand for some sort of human insight to the associated financial transactions will continue to be needed for the forseeable future.

If not and the robots do take over I welcome our silicon overlords and ask them to ponder whether money is an asset or a liability?
