"I don't know how to start this sh*t....."  
_Nasir Jones - NY State of Mind_

With a dilettante's enthusiasm I have been imagining how magnificent my words will look upon the screen.

How the great and mighty will nod in sage agreement to the jewels I present.

But the realist, the pragmatist, the cynic reminds me.....

"In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is."  
_Yogi Berra_
