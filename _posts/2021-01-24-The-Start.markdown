As Nas said on N.Y State of Mind:

"I don't know how to start this sh*t....."

With a dilettante's enthusiasm I have been imagining how magnificent my words will look upon the screen.

How the great and mighty will nod in sage agreement to the jewels I present.

But the realist, the pragmatist, the cynic reminds me of Yogi Berra's words:

"In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is."

So let's play.
