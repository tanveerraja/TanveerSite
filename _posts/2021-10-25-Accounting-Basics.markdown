### Terms & Meanings

In my interactions with non-finance colleagues I am often asked to explain specific accounting terms and processes that are brought up during a review of periodic results, discussions of forecasts or evaluation of business performance.

So what follows is a quick overview of the main concepts and terms that I think help explain what modern accounting covers:


**Financial Accounting -** deals with the construction of Financial Statements under accounting principles predominantly for external stakeholders. Very much an after the fact type of reporting that builds a narrative of what the business entity has done in financial terms over a fiscal period. Think of it as the final score at the end of a competitive sport team game.


**Management Accounting -** while operating mostly under similar accounting principles, this type of accounting is more internal stakeholder focussed and evaluates performance against plans to allow the management of a business to make informed decisions now and for the future. Therefore there will be more assumptions and estimates when trying to anticipate the future. Keeping with the sports analogy Management Accounting would be the information (experience, stats, current score) that a coach would use to determine tactics and strategy for a game still being played.


**Financial Statements -** accounting reports that summarise a business's activities over a period of time. The 3 main statements that are most familiar are Profit and Loss (or Income Statement), Balance Sheet and Cash Flow statement.


**Profit and Loss -** details the performance of the business in purely financial (i.e. money) terms over a year. Revenue that has been earned by the business less expenses incurred in generating that revenue over the same period. There are lots of rules and conventions about how these items are to be represented within the Financial Statements but the overall picture should represent a 'true and fair' view of the transactions that have taken place over the period.


**Balance Sheet -** is a snapshot in time of the business's financial health in terms of assets and liabilities. Probably the most interesting thing about the Balance Sheet is that it is supposed to balance. This means that the total sum of Assets must equal the Liabilities and Equity combined. This equation is also known as 'the accounting equation'.


**Cash Flow -** this statement summarises the inflows and outflows of cash through the business over the period. The Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet are produced on an accruals basis and necessarily don't mirror when cash is received from customers or paid out to suppliers and other authorities. It can be the case for a growing business to have made a profit on it's activities over the year, but have a net outflow of cash because money has not yet been collected.


**Assets and Liabilities -** Assets are those physical goods or rights (what the business owns / controls) that will confer economic benefit in the future. Liabilities are what the business owes - it's obligations to be met.


**Accruals -** an accrual transaction is an entry to the accounting system that represents revenue earned or expenses incurred during the period. We could have performed a service for a customer in one month but will issue the invoice the following month so we will record revenue in the period the service was actually delivered to the customer rather than waiting for the invoice to be registered or the cash received as payment. It is also required that the associated expense directly incurred in earning the revenue should be recorded in the same period.


**Deferral -** this transaction is to do with moving a revenue figure that may have arisen in advance of it being earned. For instance an automated invoicing procedure may issue an invoice to a customer before the service or goods have been delivered for use by the customer. So we defer (move) the entry from the P&L to the Balance Sheet until such time as the obligation to provide something to the customer has been completed.


**Provision -** a provision is an entry made ahead of time for a liability of uncertain time and amount but we have reasonable confidence in it being applicable to the business and some method of estimating the value. There are accounting rules as which items can be 'provided' for.


**Debit and Credit -** are the fundamental building blocks of accounting whose principles date back centuries. Debits or credits are neither good or bad just different faces of the same coin. Debits record all the money flowing into an account in the books while credits record all the money flowing out of an account. To truly grok this it is best to practice creating entries to accounts to see where each side of the entry goes.

The most basic example that has helped my colleagues in the past is:
Revenue is a credit to the P&L and creates an increase in debtors on the balance sheet. People / companies owe us money when we provide services to them.

Costs are a debit to the P&L and create an increase to creditors on the balance sheet. We owe money to people / companies that provided services to us.


**Equity -** is the amount owned to the owners of the business. It normally get's started with money that the owners put into the business entity to start it up. Sweat equity is where you get ownership with the sweat of your brow i.e. your work in exchange for ownership of the future benefits to be obtained when the business is successful.


**Accounting Bodies -** there are 2 main types - Standard Setting and Professional. The former set the rules and conventions for processing numbers and transactions to produce Financial Statements, they issue guidance on how to apply the rules and when new ones should be used. These include the FASAB (US based) and IASB (International focus). The Professional bodies are the modern equivalent of guilds that produce qualified accountants with specific letters after their name once they have passed the bar for competence and experience.

If you are still with me, hope this has helped further your understanding of Accountancy!
