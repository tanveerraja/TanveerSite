### Abstraction Theory - Money is an abstraction of Value?

If you have read my first post on [Abstraction Theory](https://tanveerraja.github.io/TanveerSite/abstraction/theory/2021/06/25/Abstraction-all-the-way-up.html) you might already know that my thinking on this model was a result of a work discussion about Accounting and accurately representing money as financial records.

So let's get the classic interpretation of money out of the way.

Money is:

1. A Medium of exchange - I give you money in exchange for goods or services.
2. A Unit of account - it can be used as a measurement of value by being fungible (a dollar is same as any other dollar) and we can add, subtract, divide and multiply units to perform commercial operations.
3. A Store of Value - the Â£20 note in my pocket can be used for transactions at a much later date and still operate in the way it was intended.

So far so good, but the above explanation tells us only how money works, how we use it.

This is important because **money is not real**.

By real I refer to something that is subject to the laws of physics and independent of needing to be mediated through a human mind.`*`

No humans = no money.

Money is a fiction, a normative protocol that humans transmit to each other.

The physical artefacts of coinage and notes are abstract representations of the human interactions and trades that we deem acceptable or are burdened by. That this is an abstraction should be obvious as we use physical currency less and less and our monetary values are held on electronic networks of Turing Machines and as binary representations of ones and zeroes.  

It is interesting to me that the digital goldbugs of Bitcoin rail against the whimsy of fiat currency, yet is there a consideration of the arbitrary value of consensually updating a public ledger after solving a difficult math problem?

This view of money has undoubtedly been informed by David Graebers - [Debt The First 5,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) and my understanding of [Fractional-reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking).

A prime example of the dangers of abstraction upon abstraction obfuscating the signal to noise is encapsulated within the [CDO financial instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation) that drove the Financial crisis of 2007-2009. The slicing of debt into tranches and then co-mingling of the different levels ignored the underlying reality that lower income people were increasingly encouraged into obligations that were ultimately too difficult to fulfil.

For me the most salient point is to be clear that when we agree a price and the exchange of money occurs we have agreed to a principle of value transfer. Not everything that is valuable needs or should be mediated through this abstraction of money, in fact in a lot of cases the signal to value can get muddied when attempting to pay for everything with money.

For example your salary is not your worth, it is your efforts / time / skills that are recognised as of economic value by your employer and abstracted to money. Just make sure that you truly understand all the value you provide or is encapsulated in the act of being employed.
