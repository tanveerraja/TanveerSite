### Abstraction Theory - What is it good for?

Great so now we have a few points of explanation to what I am referring to as Abstraction Theory but so what?

The strength of grokking abstraction is that once you are aware of using it for your mental models you can dig deeper to better appreciate what is missing from your understanding of a concept and therefore boost the real signal and correctly encapsulate the details of the concept.

While this is similar to first principles thinking in that the first principles are essential to get a solid framework for breaking down a concept and then rebuilding it into an accurate representation. The distinction is that abstraction allows you to examine how the current paradigm is built up and which details it ignores to generate a useful signal.

It may not be necessary to strip the idea all the way back down if you are aware of the abstractions in operation, it may be expedient to just identify a single thread that has been ignored but when added to the encapsulation will improve the required signal effectively.

3 examples:

Branding -
Originally a brand would be an indelible marker to establish ownership of livestock. Today a brand is an asset that confers value in the consumers mind by encapsulating desirable attributes that either we want to be associated with or offer utility. As Brands become more popular and age the original details of the company or the product itself can abstracted away such that the associated activity becomes a verb divorced from the company who established the brand.

The classic example in the UK is the action - "to Hoover" rather than "vacuum" as our American cousins do. Hoover was/is a manufacturer of electrical white goods.  

Management at C Suite level -
In my experience most CEOs, CFOs, CMOs etc. in large corporate entities use abstraction as an implicit methodology to understand, manage and control the activities of their company. The deluge of information to be parsed if they were to drill down into the finer details would simply cost too much in time and effort. That is why the reports and numbers they require are at the 40,000 feet level - individual elements are abstracted to broader movements and changes that illuminate direction of travel but not necessarily all the messy and bumpy trails traversed as part of the journey.

Internet -
As with the physical tracks that support train travel, most people don't think about the millions of miles long cabling, many miles high stacks of silicon, billions of lines of code that make up the interconnected data pipes that allow machines to speak to each other at the behest of their meat masters. All these details are abstracted away and only come to the surface if there is a disconnection in the network that we didn't expect.

It is not the ones and zeroes that are being exchanged and communicated that have our attention but the resulting text, images and sounds that are interpreted through the wizardry of electrons and binary gates. The internet, the web is encapsulated in the output on our black mirror screens that we hold in our hands, on our laps or on our desks.
