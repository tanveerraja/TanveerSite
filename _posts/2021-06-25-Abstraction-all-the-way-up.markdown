The kernel of this idea came to me around 2014/2015, after a meeting with a few colleagues about some accounting concepts. There was some confusion over reporting of certain costs in our books and one of the guys referred to "shonky accounting".

Slightly perturbed at this categorisation I attempted to explain the intricacies of accrual accounting to which I got the response it should be as easy as counting money.

After a bit of back and forth on difference between accounting and physical cash I eventually retorted "Money is just an abstraction of value".

For some reason this seemed to end the conversation. I'm not sure if this was because the other party thought my claim was profound, trite or a non-sequitur, but the thought stayed with me.

This view of money will be expanded on in a subsequent post but the overall concept of abstraction continued to interest me as time passed.

Ben Thompson's [Aggregation theory](https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/) helped to identify that maybe this concept should sit in a broader framework that helps me understand my world a bit better.

OK great. So what is it?

**Abstraction Theory** consists of 3 main elements:

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Signal and Noise

As with a lot of things this is really about information and how humans process that information. However it is the interplay of the 3 elements which I find interesting.
