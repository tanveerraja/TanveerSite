### Signal & Noise

Removing details is only truly useful as an abstraction such that what you are left with is a clear signal that can be interpreted and processed in a way that makes sense and allows further action or decision making activities.

The noise is the details that can be removed, that obfuscate the signal, not wanted or difficult to use in a coherent manner.

Signal-to-noise ratio is a fundamental aspect within communications sciences and engineering. The application of the ratio and associated math impacts our lives directly from the quality of our phone calls to the resolution of the images we entertain ourselves by sharing.

However when we are dealing with concepts and the real world, I would contend that often the noise is actually part of the substrate that supports the signal we have identified. A crude analogy might be a raft floating on top of the flowing water of a river, both flow together, the water supporting the raft.

It could be that what we have identified as noise is only categorised as noise due to our inability to process the volume of information and actually underpins the workings of the signal.
