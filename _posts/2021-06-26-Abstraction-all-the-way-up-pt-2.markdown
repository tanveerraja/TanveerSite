### Abstraction

My basic understanding of abstraction came from User Interface (UI) design and art.

From UI I discovered that the actual workings of the computer are "abstracted" in such a way that the majority of human users (myself included) can complete their objectives without needing to know all the details of those underlying operations. i.e. by using the graphical user interface and the desktop metaphor.

My experience of abstract art was of broad shapes and colours placed upon a canvas to evoke feelings and emotions but that these art pieces were gross (rather than fine) representations of reality. Or at least the reality the artists lived in versus what they perceived and communicated back as their work.

The origin of the word is from the latin _abstractus_ - meaning to draw away from.

In researching this concept further it gave me disappointing comfort that this idea is neither novel or unique.

[Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) as detailed on wikipedia is well covered in a variety of fields ranging from art to math to philosophy.

Abstraction sits within my framework as a principle of removing the details of an object / concept / idea in an attempt to deal with those factors which are important.

This process of bringing out only the most salient can be conscious or unconscious, for convenience or mandated by external concerns.
